# Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of heart disease data, aiming to provide insights and visualizations to better understand the dataset. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the data.

### Notebooks Included:
#### Heart Disease EDA - Introduction to Kaggle.ipynb
An introductory notebook providing an overview of the Kaggle dataset used for the analysis.
#### Heart Disease EDA - Age (DistPlot).ipynb

A notebook focusing on the distribution of age in the dataset, visualized using a DistPlot.
#### Heart Disease EDA - Categorical Columns (Pie Charts).ipynb

This notebook explores the categorical columns in the dataset using Pie Charts for clear visualization.
#### Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (HeatMap).ipynb

A notebook dedicated to showcasing the correlation between different features using a HeatMap.
#### Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (JointPlot).ipynb

An exploration of feature correlation using JointPlots for more detailed insights.
#### Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (PairPlot).ipynb

This notebook employs PairPlots to visualize the pairwise relationships between features and identify potential patterns.
#### Heart Disease EDA - ViolinPlot.ipynb

An analysis using ViolinPlots to understand the distribution of variables in relation to heart disease.
